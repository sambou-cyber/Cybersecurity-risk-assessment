# Bank Risk Assessment

## Overview
This repository documents a qualitative cybersecurity risk assessment
performed for a commercial bank operating in a regulated financial
environment. The assessment evaluates risks to financial assets by
estimating likelihood, severity, and overall priority.

## Objective
- Identify key risks to financial assets
- Evaluate likelihood and potential impact
- Calculate risk priority scores
- Support risk-based prioritization of security efforts

## Operating Environment
The bank services individual and commercial customers, employs both
on-site and remote staff, and operates under strict financial and
regulatory requirements. Environmental factors, human error, and
third-party dependencies influence the bank’s risk profile.

## Risk Assessment Method
Risks were evaluated using a qualitative scoring model:

Likelihood × Severity = Risk Priority

Likelihood and severity were scored on a scale of 1–3 based on potential
frequency and business impact.

## Risks Evaluated
- Business Email Compromise
- Compromised User Database
- Financial Records Leak
- Theft
- Supply Chain Disruption

## Risk Prioritization
Risks were categorized based on priority scores to help determine which
risks require immediate attention versus ongoing monitoring.

## Outcome
The completed risk register highlights high impact risks and supports
informed decision making when allocating security resources.
